- Creating Team Form: The team creation form includes one field for entering the team name. After clicking the save button, the team will be created.
  
- Team Accordion Header: Each team accordion header displays the team's name, delete button, and edit button. Clicking the edit button allows the user to edit the team name directly within the header. If no changes are made, the name remains unchanged. The delete button opens a delete confirmation modal with two options: delete and cancel. Clicking delete will delete the team and its associated members.

- Dropdown Icon: The dropdown icon in the accordion header expands the accordion and reveals the content section.

Clicking the edit button allows the user to edit the member's name within the table. Clicking the delete button opens a delete confirmation modal. Once confirmed, the member is removed.
